# Arduino Code :100:

Required libraries (install them from the built in library manager):
* EtherCard (1.1.0)
  * Only needed for using the Arduino Nano ethernet shield. The Uno-style shield (on the Megas) uses the built in ethernet library.
  * [GitHub](https://github.com/njh/EtherCard)

## Testing Programs

### servo_test.ino

This program is good for calibrating/testing a single talon (our motor controller).
To use it, change `#define PIN_SERVO 31` to whatever Arduino pin you're connecting the signal wire to, upload the code, and then open the serial monitor.
When you send a number to the Arduino it will write it to the servo.
When calibrating, use the range 10 to 170 instead of the full 0 to 180 because it freaks out the talons. 90 degrees will be still.

## Rover Programs

### wheel_controller.ino

This should be uploaded to the Arduino Nano in the e-box. The macro `#define DEBUG_MODE 0` can enable serial debugging messages. Don't use this when running the rover because it can cause the Arduino to randomly reset.

### arm_controller.ino

This is the code for the Arduino Nano controlling the currently used arm (the one with linear actuators). It currently communicates over serial, so it would be nice to change this over to ethernet at some point. It is designed to be used with the udp_rover program in it's current state.
