# Guidelines
Please follow these guidelines for keeping our code and repository organized:
* Use camelCase for variables, CamelCase for class names
* For C/C++, put curly brackets on their own lines
* Name Arduino sketches with the subsystem name at the beginning. e.g. wheel_controller.ino arm_control.ino
