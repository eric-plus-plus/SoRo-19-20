title: Filtering features with WebGL
shortdesc: Using WebGL to filter large quantities of features
docs: >
  This example shows how to use `ol/renderer/webgl/PointsLayer` to dynamically filter a large amount
    of point geometries. The above map is based on a dataset from the NASA containing 45k recorded meteorite
    landing sites. Each meteorite is marked by a circle on the map (the bigger the circle, the heavier
    the object). A pulse effect has been added, which is slightly offset by the year of the impact.

  Adjusting the sliders causes the objects outside of the date range to be filtered out of the map. This is done using
    a custom fragment shader on the layer renderer, and by using the `v_opacity` attribute of the rendered objects
    to store the year of impact.
