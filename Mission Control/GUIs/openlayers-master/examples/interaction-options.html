title: Interaction Options
shortdesc: Shows interaction options for custom scroll and zoom behavior.
docs: >
  This example uses a custom `ol/interaction/defaults` configuration:
  by default, wheel/trackpad zoom and drag panning is always active, which
  can be unexpected on pages with a lot of scrollable content and an embedded
  map. To perform wheel/trackpad zoom and drag-pan actions only when the map
  has the focus, set `onFocusOnly: true` as option. This requires a map div
  with a `tabindex` attribute set.
