title: Layer Zoom Limits
shortdesc: Using minZoom and maxZoom to control layer visibility.
docs: >
  Layers support `minZoom` and `maxZoom` options for controlling visibility based on the view's zoom level.
  If min or max zoom are set, the layer will only be visible at zoom levels greater than the `minZoom` and
  less than or equal to the `maxZoom`.  After construction, the layer's `setMinZoom` and `setMaxZoom` can
  be used to set limits.  This example shows an OSM layer at zoom levels 14 and lower and a USGS layer at
  zoom levels higher than 14.
